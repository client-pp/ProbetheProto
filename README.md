# ProbetheProto
## Overview
We implemented a prototype of ProbetheProto in "Probe the Proto: Measuring Client-Side PrototypePollution Vulnerabilities of One Million Real-world Websites" and evaluated it on one million websites. The results reveal that 545 real-world websites---including one among the top 1,000---are vulnerable to prototype pollution with zero-day, exploitable vulnerabilities. 

This repository contains source codes of ProbetheProto: the Chromium-based dynamic-taint-analysis engine, the Exploit Generator module, the Result Validation module and the Defense analysis module.
